# Work time app

A minimalistic Android application written in Java for tracking work hours. 

## Background

The request to make it came from my father, a truck driver. The applications they have to use at work are often made without consideration of the harsh working environment and constant hurry. They often have small buttons, little text, too many colors, and a poorly planned structure. 

## Design and research

After researching the domain, including how and when the app is used during work (often with one hand, but not always) and going through several UI redesign iterations according to the requirements, I wrote my version of the tool. For now, it has basic functionality, a clear UI, and a protection against accidental clicks (requires a confirmation press with a button moved).

## Current state

After testing the app in the real environment, a new set of changes was identified. There are as well more features to be added so the project is still under development.
